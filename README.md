# Finance Year Folder Generator

This Python script (`generate_folder_subfolder_bydate.py`) is designed to generate a folder structure corresponding to financial years, with subfolders representing each month within the financial year.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `make_folders_by_year_progression.py` in your terminal or Python environment.

2. **Input Start and End Years**: The script will prompt you to input the start and end years for which you want to generate the folder structure. Enter the start and end years in the format `yyyy` (e.g., `2021`).

3. **Generated Folders**: The script will create a folder structure within the `./finance_years` directory. Each top-level folder represents a financial year (e.g., `2021-2022`). Within each financial year folder, subfolders are created to represent each month (e.g., `1-April 2021`, `2-May 2021`, ... `12-March 2022`).
